# Morserino-bluetooth
Experimental build of Morserino acting as an HID Bluetooth keyboard

This is a proof of concept only based on v4.2 of the Morserino code. 

This will show up as a USB keyboard tagged as "Morserino32"

I had to disable all Wifi functionality to make enough memory available to fit the BT-HID libraries.


DO NOT FLASH THIS BUILD UNLESS YOU ARE COMFORTABLE WITH RESETTING YOUR MORSERINO VIA USB!
